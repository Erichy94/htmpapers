### [A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World][1]
This paper proposes a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. The model introduces a new feature to cortical columns, location information, which is represented relative to the object being sensed. Pairing sensory features with locations is a requirement for modeling objects and therefore must occur somewhere in the neocortex. We propose it occurs in every column in every region.

### [The HTM Spatial Pooler â€“ a neocortical algorithm for online sparse distributed coding][2]
This paper describes an important component of HTM, the HTM spatial pooler, which is a neurally inspired algorithm that learns sparse distributed representations online. Written from a neuroscience perspective, the paper demonstrates key computational properties of HTM spatial pooler.
