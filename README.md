### [Why Does the Neocortex Have Layers and Columns, A Theory of Learning the 3D Structure of the World  • Jeff Hawkins, Subutai Ahmad & Yuwei Cui • Neuroscience • Preprint of journal submission • 2017/07/12][1]
This paper proposes a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. The model introduces a new feature to cortical columns, location information, which is represented relative to the object being sensed. Pairing sensory features with locations is a requirement for modeling objects and therefore must occur somewhere in the neocortex. We propose it occurs in every column in every region.
